# Java-Calculator
<p> This is a calculator that is fully coded in java where the frontend uses the Swing framework.
It also uses a dependencies that allow calculation based on a string expression. This calculator supports most of the features of a basic scientific calculator. At the moment
it can not calculate sin, cos, tan. The reason I created this project was to enhance my experience of using Java, the Swing framework, and learning how to add dependencies to projects
using Maven.</p>

<h2> Dependencies </h2>
<li> StringUtils.isNumeric(String) - is used in the project to help determine if the user had entered a valid integer </li>
<li> <a href="https://mathparser.org/"> Math Parser </a> - used to parse through the string expression and calculate said expresion </li>

<h2> Try it out yourself </h2>
<p> In the root directory there is a jar file that you can execute. </p>
